# readmeme

## Who?
Mikhail Panchenko <m@mihasya.com>

## What?
A README generator based on 5Ws

## When?
After one hour too many spent reading source code to determine the purpose of a project

## Where?
Foggy San Francisco

## Why?
Because the README is the face of a project. It should contain useful information.

## Installation

For now, you'll have to have Go installed.

```
go get github.com/mihasya/readmeme
```

## Usage

```
readmeme [-of <filename>]
```

## Details

The top section of this README was generated using `readmeme`

Props to Richard Crowley (again) for helping name this thing. It works so well - hopefully it starts a "meme" of useful READMEs.
