## Who?
Mikhail Panchenko <m@mihasya.com>

## What?
A program that helps generate simple READMEs using the Five Ws.

## When?
One sunny morning while doing research for a new product and having to read the source of one too many project in order to determine what it did

## Where?
San Francisco, CA

## Why?
Because we've had a way to summarize things [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws#History](for centuries), yet we continue to see repos that contain very little useful information.

## How?
With just a little bit of Go code and by reminding myself to just get the most basic thing out before being overwhelmed by the possibilities.
